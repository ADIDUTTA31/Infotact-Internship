Basic Linux Command-Line Navigation
In this topic, I learned how to move around and work with files and directories using the Linux terminal. The command line is a powerful tool in Linux, and knowing how to use it is important for every cybersecurity or IT professional.

Here are some basic commands I covered:
- **pwd** — Print current directory  
- **ls** — List files and folders  
- **cd** — Change directory  
- **mkdir** — Create directory  
- **rmdir** — Remove empty directory  
- **touch** — Create empty file  
- **cat** — Show file content  
- **rm** — Remove file  
- **mv** — Move or rename files/directories  
- **cp** — Copy files or directories  
- **head** — Show first lines of a file  
- **tail** — Show last lines of a file  
- **find** — Search for files and directories  
- **file** — Check file type  
- **man** — Shows manual/help for commands  
- **echo** — Print text or variables to the screen  
- **chmod** — Change file permissions (a bit advanced but important)
